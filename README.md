College-Compass is a demo web application designed to help students find the best engineering colleges in Maharashtra based on their MHT CET or JEE Main percentile. The website allows users to explore college options by considering various factors like percentile, seat type (EWS, Open, OBC, etc.), branch preferences, and more.

Key Features:

College Prediction: Based on MHT CET or JEE Main percentile and seat type, students can predict which engineering colleges they are eligible for.
Branch Selection: Users can filter college results based on preferred engineering branches such as Computer Science, Mechanical, Civil, and others.
In-depth College Information: Students can view detailed information about each college, including:
Average package offered to students
Available facilities
College reviews
Different branches and seat distribution
Bookmark Colleges: Users can bookmark their favorite colleges for quick access later.
Search by Preference: Direct search functionality to find colleges based on custom preferences, such as city, facilities, or branch.
This project is currently a demo website that showcases core functionality, allowing students to navigate through colleges and explore their options. Future updates will add more comprehensive features.
